      This is the heading with the name of the website ("the Historion") and the 
      navigation pane that a user can click to be brought to the next web-pages. 
      
      CSS was used to make the navigation pane more eye-pleasing.
      Once a user hovers above an option in the navigation menu, the color of the option will change 
      to make it appear as a button.-->

      <h3>About Website</h3>
      <p>
        Hello! My name is Owner and I made this webiste. This website will be
        about history, hence the name "Historion". The topics that will be shown
        here are mostly Ancient History and European history (yes, two very
        different topics on the same website), with focus on art, culture,
        mthology/folklore, military, architecture, economy and geography. Fun! I
        hope you will be <strike>confused</strike> interested!
      </p>
      <p>
        "Weekly-Study" is a weekly study about an ancient civilization. Every
        time there will be an introduction about the civilization, geographical
        location of the civilization, the peak of the civilization, the collapse
        of the civilization and archaeological findings of famous arrcheologists
        in that area. The Weekly Study will be updated every week, and on every
        4<sup>th</sup> of the month the <i>continents</i> on which the
        civilization is located will change.
      </p>
      <p>
        The purpose of this site is to bring more people attention to history,
        and tell the history of historical civilizations that are not found in
        the regular school curriculum
        <sub>(unless they are in the school curriculum)</sub>. I hope you enjoy
        my work!
