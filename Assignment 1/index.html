      This is the heading with the name of the website ("the Historion") and the 
      navigation pane that a user can click to be brought to the next web-pages. 
      
      CSS was used to make the navigation pane more eye-pleasing.
      Once a user hovers above an option in the navigation menu, the color of the option will change 
      to mak eit appear as a button.
