/* 
  The color families that I have chosen are red and cyan (blue or light-blue). I chose 
  those color families because they are complementary colors on the color wheel.

  I feel that red represent the client's purpose bacause red catches a user's attention,
  and is associated with energy and action. In addition, in the Indigenous medicine wheel,
  red represnts the south (which is where Treaty One is located; the south). In many Indigenous and
  Native-American cultures children are dressed in red during ceremonies and traditions as an 
  introduction to their ancestors and a call upon the guardians to guard their children. 
  In Native American cultures red represents the Earth-element and is 
  why many tribes paint their bodies and faces with red. Due to this webiste's purpose 
  to inform about Treaty One and honor the Indigenous and Native-American cultures, I felt 
  that red was a perfect match for this. 

  The second color that I chose was cyan (or light-blue). Blue represnts stability,
  harmony, peace and calm, which was the purpose the treaties were made with(so both 
  Indigenous Peoples and Europeans could live together in harmony). Blue is also tied closely
  with the sky, and many Indigenous and Native-American cultures use blue as a representation of 
  Father Sky. In addition, Blue relates to water, representing the famous sentence that was said 
  during the negotiations for Treaty One, stating that Treaty One would be in place 
  “...as long as the sun shines, the grass grows and the river flows...”. 
  It is also important to understand that blue is the color of the Métis flag, and the 
  land where Treaty One is located is the nation's traditional land.
  Considering that this website is meant to inform people about Treaty One and respect the traditional
  cultures that negotiated the treaty, I decided to use the color cyan (light-blue) as a color on 
  my website to balance the red. 

  I used a serif font because the website's purpose is to inform people, and by using 
  a serif font the webiste will come across as trustworthy, established and reliable (because
  people come to this website to be informed about the treaties).
